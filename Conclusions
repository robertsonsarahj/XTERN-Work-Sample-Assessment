about 150 restaurants behind it with 631 restaurants that carry it.

2. Of the restaurants that have 50 or more reviews, the type of food with the highest rating is 
Continental food with a rating of 3.98, with Italian as a very close second with a rating of 3.97

3. The food type that takes the most time to cook on average is Belgian food taking 65 minutes 
with Kashmiri in second taking 10 minutes less.

4. The food type that is the most expensive on average is Cantonese food with an average price of
